======================
in .env file change the database details
=======================
php artisan make:migration create_articles_table --create=articles

If you use maria db , there will be an issue with the length of string, to fix that follow below:
Go AppServiceProvider class
add use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;
===============================
to create dummy data generate a seeder under database folder
php artisan make:seeder ArticlesTableSeeder
than go to the run function of this new seeder class and paste below code to create 30 articles
factory(App\Articles::class, 30)->create();

Than go to database seeder and call the article seeder from run method
than run php artisan make:factory ArticleFactory

Than in ArticlesFactory class mention size of each article title and 
also make sure to rename Model to Article
===============================
To create a new Article model
php artisan make:model Article

Than run the migration
php artisan migrate , this will create the article database table.

than run the seed to insert dummy articles
php artisan db:seed
now it sud insert 30 artilces in the table
===========================================
To create controller with resourse
php artisan make:controller ArticleController --resource
this will create all the crud methods along with index inside the controller
===========================================
than go to routes/api.php for creating endpoints
===================================
than create resource
php artisan make:resource Article
it will create a http/resource/Article.php file
============================
Next go to controller and write code to get some articles
====================
use REST CLIENT/Postman http://localhost/larticles/public/api/articles
now if we dont want created and updated date than we can modify the Article resource file
so in the resources/article file you can format the response as per the need
=========================
if you want response to not be wrapped in data than in AppServiceProvider use  Resource::withoutWrapping();
